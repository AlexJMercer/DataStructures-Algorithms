# **Bubble Sort**

> Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, but not one of the most efficient.
>
> It puts a list into increasing order by successively comparing adjacent elements, interchanging them if they are in the wrong order.
>
> To carry out the Bubble Sort, we interchange a larger element with a smaller one following it, starting at the beginning of the list, for a full pass.
>
> This procedure is iterated until the sort is complete.
>
> It is called Bubble Sort, because the smaller elements "bubble" to the top as they are interchanged.
> Meanwhile the larger elements "sink" to the bottom.
