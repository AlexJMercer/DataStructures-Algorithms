# **Bubble Sort**

### **How it Works :**
> Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, but not one of the most efficient.
>
> It puts a list into increasing order by successively comparing adjacent elements, interchanging them if they are in the wrong order.
>
> To carry out the Bubble Sort, we interchange a larger element with a smaller one following it, starting at the beginning of the list, for a full pass.
>
> This procedure is iterated until the sort is complete.
>
> It is called Bubble Sort, because the smaller elements "bubble" to the top as they are interchanged.
> Meanwhile the larger elements "sink" to the bottom.

### **Performance :**
> - **Time Complexity** : Bubble Sort has two nested ``for``-loops, hence it is given a worst-case time complexity of **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**.
>
> - **Space Complexity** : It only needs a fixed amount of space for operations on the array, hence it has a space complexity of **O(1)**.

### **Advantages of Bubble Sort :**
> - Requires very little memory.
> 
> - Only requires a few lines of code.
>
> - Best case Time Complexity is **O(n)**, which is helpful in determining whether a list/array is sorted or not.

### **Disadvantages of Bubble Sort :**
> - It is highly inefficient for large data-sets as Bubble Sort has a worst case Time-Complexity of **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**.
>
> - Presence of turtles can significantly slow down the sorting process.
