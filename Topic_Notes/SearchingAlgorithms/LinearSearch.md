# **Linear Search / Sequential Search**

> ### **General Searching Problem :**
> - Consider a list of elements _a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>_.
> - An element _x_ is to be determined whether or not it is in the list.
> - The solution to this search is the location of the term in the list that equals _x_.
> - In case _x_ is not in the list, the solution is 0.

## **How It Works :**
> - The algorithm begins by comparing _x_ to _a<sub>1</sub>_.
> - When _x_ = _a<sub>1</sub>_, solution is the location/index of _a<sub>1</sub>_.
> - If _x_ != _a<sub>1</sub>_, compare with next element in the list, and so on.
> - If no match occurs, the solution is 0.
