# **Greedy Algorithms :**

> Some algorithms are designed to solve **optimization problems**.
>
> The goal of such problems is to find a solution to the given problem that either minimizes or maximizes the value of some parameter.
>
> One of the simplest approaches often leads to a solution of an optimization problem.

#### **How it Works :**
> - This approach selects the best choice at each step, instead of considering all sequences of steps that may lead to an optimal solution.
> - Algorithms that make the best choices at each step are called "Greedy Algorithms".
>
> - After a feasible solution is found, we need to determine whether the algorithm has found an optimal solution.
> - To do that, we either prove that the solution is optimal, **or** show a counter-example where the algorithm yields a non-optimal solution.
