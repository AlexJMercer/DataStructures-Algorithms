# Stacks

### **Definition :**
> A stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion functions are allowed only at the end, called the _top of the stack_.

&nbsp;

#### **Stack as an ADT :**
> When we define a stack as an _ADT_ (Abstract Data Type), then we are only interested in knowing the stack operations from the user point of view.

> This means we are not interested in knowing the implementation details at this moment. We are only interested in knowing what type of operations we can perform on the stack.

&nbsp;
### **Primary Stack Operations :**
>
> - **Push** : Inserts data into the stack.
>
> - **Pop** : Deletes the last inserted element from the stack.

&nbsp;
### **Secondary Stack Operations :**
> - **Top** : Returns last inserted element without removing it.
>
> - **Size** : Returns size of stack, or number of elements in the stack.
>
> - **isEmpty** : Returns TRUE or FALSE depending upon if the stack is empty or not.
>
> - **isFull** : Returns TRUE or FALSE depending upon if the stack is full.
